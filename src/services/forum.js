        post: "I use the 20-80 formula. 20% of the time on rudiments, skill, technique. 80% of the time working on songs or just playing along to the radio. Since it's a percentage, it fits any amount of time whether it's ten minutes or two hours. My neighbors would be p*ssed if I played two hours a day broken up over the whole day. They prefer I get my practice done in one shot. An hour a day works well for me.",

        post: "Hey Aali, you can use the play along tracks (in the sidebar menu) or the songs in the song section to practice with. You can also use your own music via your phone etc to play along with. When I started playing we never had online lessons so I used to practice with CDs etc. Youtube is another option as others have said. From the lessons, many have tracks you can practice along to in the \"Resources\" tab to download",
